        <h1 style="font-size:50px;">GIT AND GITHUB TUTORIAL</h1>
        <div class="a">1.Overview of Git and GitHub</div>
        <p style="color: red;"> A.What is Git?</p>
        <p>Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).</p>
        <p style="color: red;"> B.What is GitHub?</p>
        <p>GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.</p>
        <p style="color: red;"> C.why do we need to use them?</p>
        <p style="color: blue;"> C1.why we use Git?</p>
        <p>Version control is the only reasonable way to keep track of changes in code, manuscripts, presentations, and data analysis projects. I used to make numbered tar.gz files for a project. But exploring the differences is difficult, to say the least. And if you use git properly, you’ll have annotated each small change.</p>
        <p style="color:blue;"> C2.why we use GitHub?</p>
        <p>Github lowers the barriers to collaboration. It’s easy to offer suggested changes to others’ code through github. I was able to fix a mistake in the phobos library for the D programming language, because it’s hosted on github. I fixed some problems in some very useful code developed by someone I don’t know, because it’s hosted on github.</p>
        <div class="a">2.How to install Git and GitHub?</div>
        <p style="color:red;"> A.Install Git</p>
        <p style="color:blue;"> A1.Installing on Linux</p>
        <p>If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so through the package management tool that comes with your distribution. If you’re on Fedora (or any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:  </p>
        <h1 style = "color: blueviolet;">$ sudo dnf install git-all</h1>
        <p style="color:blue;"> A2.Installing on macOS</p>
        <p>There are several ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time.</p>
        <h1 style = "color: blueviolet;">$ git --version</h1>
        <p>If you don't have it install already .it will promote you to install it.</p>
        <p style="color:blue;"> A3.Installing on Windows</p>
        <p>There are also a few ways to install Git on Windows. The most official build is available for download on the Git website. Just go to https://git-scm.com/download/win and the download will start automatically. Note that this is a project called Git for Windows, which is separate from Git itself; for more information on it, go to https://gitforwindows.org.

          To get an automated installation you can use the Git Chocolatey package. Note that the Chocolatey package is community maintained.
          
          Another easy way to get Git installed is by installing GitHub Desktop. The installer includes a command line version of Git as well as the GUI. It also works well with PowerShell, and sets up solid credential caching and sane CRLF settings. We’ll learn more about those things a little later, but suffice it to say they’re things you want. You can download this from the GitHub Desktop website.</p>
        <p style="color:blue;"> A4.Installing from Source</p>
        <p>If you do want to install Git from source, you need to have the following libraries that Git depends on: autotools, curl, zlib, openssl, expat, and libiconv. For example, if you’re on a system that has dnf (such as Fedora) or apt-get (such as a Debian-based system), you can use one of these commands to install the minimal dependencies for compiling and installing the Git binaries:</p>
        <h1 style="color: blueviolet;">$ sudo dnf install dh-autoreconf curl-devel expat-devel gettext-devel \
          openssl-devel perl-devel zlib-devel
        </h1>
        <h1 style="color: blueviolet;">$ sudo apt-get install dh-autoreconf libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev \
          gettext libz-dev libssl-dev</h1>
          <p style="color:red;"> B.Install GitHub</p>
          <p>The installation of GitHub Desktop is as simple as any other Windows application installation. All you need to do is:</p>
          <p>1.Open a browser.</p>
          <p>2.Visit desktop.github.com.</p>
          <p>3Click Download for WIndows (64bit)..</p>
          <p>4.When prompted, click Run.</p>
          <p>5.Allow the installation to download and install.</p>
          <p>&******************************************</p>
          <p>Once the installation completes, GitHub Desktop will launch.</p>
          <div class="a">3.Basic Git commands: config, add, commit, push</div>
          <p style="color: red;">A.Config</p>        
          <p>In this document, we'll take an in-depth look at the git config command. We briefly discussed git config usage on our Setting up a Repository page. The git config command is a convenience function that is used to set Git configuration values on a global or local project level. These configuration levels correspond to .ipconfig text files</p>
          <img src="Politico/Screenshot (199).png" alt="deskop">
          <p>In this example, email is a child property of the user configuration block. This will return the configured email address, if any, that Git will associate with locally created commits.</p>
          <p style="color: red;">B.Add</p>
          <p></p>
