        <h1 style="font-size:50px;">GIT AND GITHUB TUTORIAL</h1>
        <div class="a">1.Overview of Git and GitHub</div>
        <p style="color: red;"> A.What is Git?</p>
        <p>Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).</p>
        <p style="color: red;"> B.What is GitHub?</p>
        <p>GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.</p>
        <p style="color: red;"> C.why do we need to use them?</p>
        <p style="color: blue;"> C1.why we use Git?</p>
        <p>Version control is the only reasonable way to keep track of changes in code, manuscripts, presentations, and data analysis projects. I used to make numbered tar.gz files for a project. But exploring the differences is difficult, to say the least. And if you use git properly, you’ll have annotated each small change.</p>
        <p style="color:blue;"> C2.why we use GitHub?</p>
        <p>Github lowers the barriers to collaboration. It’s easy to offer suggested changes to others’ code through github. I was able to fix a mistake in the phobos library for the D programming language, because it’s hosted on github. I fixed some problems in some very useful code developed by someone I don’t know, because it’s hosted on github.</p>
        <div class="a">2.How to install Git and GitHub?</div>
        <p style="color:red;"> A.Install Git</p>
        <p style="color:blue;"> A1.Installing on Linux</p>
        <p>If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so through the package management tool that comes with your distribution. If you’re on Fedora (or any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:  </p>
        <h1 style = "color: blueviolet;">$ sudo dnf install git-all</h1>
        <p style="color:blue;"> A2.Installing on macOS</p>
        <p>There are several ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time.</p>
        <h1 style = "color: blueviolet;">$ git --version</h1>
        <p>If you don't have it install already .it will promote you to install it.</p>
        <p style="color:blue;"> A3.Installing on Windows</p>
        <p>There are also a few ways to install Git on Windows. The most official build is available for download on the Git website. Just go to https://git-scm.com/download/win and the download will start automatically. Note that this is a project called Git for Windows, which is separate from Git itself; for more information on it, go to https://gitforwindows.org.

          To get an automated installation you can use the Git Chocolatey package. Note that the Chocolatey package is community maintained.
          
          Another easy way to get Git installed is by installing GitHub Desktop. The installer includes a command line version of Git as well as the GUI. It also works well with PowerShell, and sets up solid credential caching and sane CRLF settings. We’ll learn more about those things a little later, but suffice it to say they’re things you want. You can download this from the GitHub Desktop website.</p>
        <p style="color:blue;"> A4.Installing from Source</p>
        <p>If you do want to install Git from source, you need to have the following libraries that Git depends on: autotools, curl, zlib, openssl, expat, and libiconv. For example, if you’re on a system that has dnf (such as Fedora) or apt-get (such as a Debian-based system), you can use one of these commands to install the minimal dependencies for compiling and installing the Git binaries:</p>
        <h1 style="color: blueviolet;">$ sudo dnf install dh-autoreconf curl-devel expat-devel gettext-devel \
          openssl-devel perl-devel zlib-devel
        </h1>
        <h1 style="color: blueviolet;">$ sudo apt-get install dh-autoreconf libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev \
          gettext libz-dev libssl-dev</h1>
          <p style="color:red;"> B.Install GitHub</p>
          <p>The installation of GitHub Desktop is as simple as any other Windows application installation. All you need to do is:</p>
          <p>1.Open a browser.</p>
          <p>2.Visit desktop.github.com.</p>
          <p>3Click Download for WIndows (64bit)..</p>
          <p>4.When prompted, click Run.</p>
          <p>5.Allow the installation to download and install.</p>
          <p>&******************************************</p>
          <p>Once the installation completes, GitHub Desktop will launch.</p>
          <div class="a">3.Basic Git commands: config, add, commit, push</div>
          <p style="color: red;">A.Config</p>        
          <p>In this document, we'll take an in-depth look at the git config command. We briefly discussed git config usage on our Setting up a Repository page. The git config command is a convenience function that is used to set Git configuration values on a global or local project level. These configuration levels correspond to .ipconfig text files</p>
          <img src="Politico/Screenshot (199).png" alt="deskop">
          <p>In this example, email is a child property of the user configuration block. This will return the configured email address, if any, that Git will associate with locally created commits.</p>
          <p style="color: red;">B.Add</p>
          <p> if you git add a deleted file the deletion is staged for commit. The language of "add" when you're actually "deleting" can be confusing. If you think or use git stage in place of git add, the reality of what is happening may be more clear.

            git add and git commit (which we will look for it later) go together hand in hand. They don't work when they aren't used together. And, they both work best when used thinking of their joint functionality.</p>
            <img src="politico/Screenshot (201).png" alt="desktop">
            <p style="color: red;">C.Commit</p> 
            <p>Git commit command takes a snapshot representing the staged changes.</p>
            <h1 style="color: violet;">git add "a file"</h1>
            <p>After running the Git commit command, you need to type in the description of the commit in the text editor.

              This Git commit example shows how you set the description with the commit function:</p>
            <h1 style="color: violet;">git commit -m "message"</h1>

            <p>The following example shows how to save a snapshot of changes done in the whole working directory. This code only works for tracked files.</p>
            <img src="politico/Screenshot (203).png" alt="">
            <p style="color: red;">D.Push</p> 
            <p>After you make and commit changes locally, you can share them with the remote repository using: "git push". Pushing changes to the remote makes your commits accessible to others who you may be collaborating with. This will also update any open pull requests with the branch that you're working on.</p>
             <img src="politico/Screenshot (206).png" alt="">
             <div class="a">4.How to resolve conflicts?</div>
             <p>1.Open Git Bash.</p>
             <p>2.Navigate into the local Git repository that has the merge conflict.</p>
             <h1 style="color: violet;">cd REPOSITORY-NAME</h1>
             <p>3.Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict. In this example, the file styleguide.md has a merge conflict.</p>
             <p>4.Open your favorite text editor, such as Atom, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.</p>
             <p>5.To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker <<<<<<<. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line <<<<<<< HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by >>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote "open an issue" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote "ask your question in IRC" in the compare branch or branch-a.</p>
             <p>6.Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> and make the changes you want in the final merge. In this example, both changes are incorporated into the final merge:</p>
             <h1 style="color: violet;">If you have questions, please open an issue or ask in our IRC channel if it's more urgent.</h1>
             <p>7.Add or stage your changes.</p>
             <h1 style="color: violet;">$ git add .</h1>
             <p>8.Commit your changes with a comment.</p>
             <h1 style="color: violet;">$ git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict by incorporating both suggestions."</h1>

             <div class="a">5.Branch?</div>
             <p style="color: red;">What is branch?</p>
             <p>Branching is a feature available in most modern version control systems. Branching in other VCS's can be an expensive operation in both time and disk space. In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future's history before merging it into the main branch.</p>
              <img src="Politico/Screenshot (210).png" alt="">
              <p>The diagram above visualizes a repository with two isolated lines of development, one for a little feature, and one for a longer-running feature. By developing them in branches, it’s not only possible to work on both of them in parallel, but it also keeps the main master branch free from questionable code.</p>
              <p style="color: red;">How Branch work?</p>
              <p>A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.</p>

              <p>The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn’t let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.</p>
